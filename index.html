    <P id="P1"> <i> Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum) is the capital of the southern Indian state of Kerala.
       It's distinguished by its British colonial architecture and many art galleries.
       It’s also home to Kuthira Malika (or Puthen Malika) Palace, adorned with carved horses
       and displaying collections related to the Travancore royal family, whose regional capital
       was here from the 18th–20th centuries.</i></P>
